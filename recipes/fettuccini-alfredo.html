    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Fettuccini Alfredo, a luxurious Italian pasta creation, seduces with its creamy allure. Silky fettuccini noodles intertwine gracefully with a velvety Alfredo sauce, born from the harmonious union of butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese. A symphony of flavors emerges, as the sweet, nutty Parmesan melds with the indulgent richness of butter and cream. This dish is a canvas for personalization, accommodating grilled chicken, succulent shrimp, or vibrant roasted vegetables for added depth. Topped with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or a dash of cracked black pepper, Fettuccini Alfredo is a culinary masterpiece, inviting you to savor the essence of Italian comfort and sophistication in a single, decadent bite.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>10 ounces fettuccini pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
        <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.</li>
        <li>Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.</li>
        <l1><strong>Enjoy!</strong></l1>
